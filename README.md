## Getting Started

To install the latest KubeFin release in primary cluster from the official manifest, run the following command.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubefin/kubefin/releases/latest/download/kubefin.yaml
```
Once your KubeFin has been installed, wait for the pod to be ready and port forward with:

```shell
kubectl port-forward -nkubefin svc/kubefin-cost-analyzer-service 8080 3000
```
To verify that the dashboard and server are running, you may access the KubeFin dashboard at http://localhost:3000.
